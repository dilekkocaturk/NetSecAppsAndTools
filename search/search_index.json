A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules. Firewalls have been a first line of defense in network security for over 25 years. They establish a barrier between secured and controlled internal networks that can be trusted and untrusted outside networks, such as the Internet. A firewall can be hardware, software, software-as-a service (SaaS), public cloud, or private cloud (virtual). Importance of Firewalls So, what is the purpose of a firewall and why is it important? Unprotected networks are vulnerable to any traffic trying to access your systems. Network traffic should always be inspected, whether malicious or not. Connecting personal computers to other IT systems or the Internet provides a number of benefits, including easy collaboration with others, pooling of resources, and enhanced creativity. However, this may come at the expense of complete network and device protection. Hacking, identity theft, malware and internet fraud are common threats faced by users who connect their computers to a network or the Internet, leaving themselves vulnerable to attacks. Once discovered by a malicious actor, your network and devices can be easily located, quickly accessed, and exposed to repeated threats. 24-hour internet connections increase this risk (because your network can be accessed at any time). Proactive protection is crucial when using any type of network. Users can protect their networks from the worst threats by using a firewall. IDS/IPS Systems What Is IDS and IPS? Intrusion detection is the process of monitoring your network traffic and analyzing it for signs of possible intrusions, such as exploit attempts and incidents that may be imminent threats to your network. For its part, intrusion prevention is the process of performing intrusion detection and then stopping the detected incidents, typically done by dropping packets or terminating sessions. These security measures are available as intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS), which are part of network security measures taken to detect and stop potential incidents and are included functionality within next-generation firewalls (NGFW). What Are the Benefits of IDS/IPS? IDS/IPS monitors all traffic on the network to identify any known malicious behavior. One of the ways in which an attacker will try to compromise a network is by exploiting a vulnerability within a device or within software. IDS/IPS identifies those exploit attempts and blocks them before they successfully compromise any endpoints within the network. IDS/IPS are necessary security technologies, both at the network edge and within the data center, precisely because they can stop attackers while they are gathering information about your network. Antivirus Software What Is Antivirus Software? Antivirus software (computer protection software) is a program(s) that is created to search, detect, prevent and remove software viruses from your system that can harm your system. Other harmful software such as worms, adware, and other threats can also be detected and removed via antivirus. This software is designed to be used as a proactive approach to cyber security, preventing threats from entering your computer and causing issues. Most antivirus software operates in the background once installed, providing real-time protection against virus attacks. Examples of antivirus software: Avast Free Antivirus AVG AntiVirus Avira Free Antivirus Bitdefender Antivirus Kaspersky Free Antivirus Panda Free Antivirus Windows Defender Malwarebytes AVG TuneUp Spybot 2 Why Is Antivirus Important? Antivirus protection is essential for any business wanting to protect their data and computer systems from becoming corrupted. Antivirus software is the security person at the gate preventing unwanted persons from entering. Prevention is much more effective than cure, so it\u2019s better to have a system in place designed to detect and prevent virus attacks than having to spend time and money repairing infected machines. VPN (Virtual Private Network) What Is a Virtual Private Network (VPN)? A virtual private network, or VPN, is an encrypted connection over the Internet from a device to a network. The encrypted connection helps ensure that sensitive data is safely transmitted. It prevents unauthorized people from eavesdropping on the traffic and allows the user to conduct work remotely. VPN technology is widely used in corporate environments. Benefits of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) Virtual private networks (VPNs) provide users with secure, seamless remote access to corporate networks and resources when traveling or working remotely. The privacy and integrity of sensitive information are ensured through multi-factor authentication, endpoint system compliance scanning, and encryption of all transmitted data. A remote secure access strategy promotes collaboration and connectivity between teams, networks, and offices across the world. Connectivity and secure access can easily be achieved with a remote secure access VPN.","title":"Fundamental Security Applications"},{"location":"fundSecApps/#fundamental-security-applications","text":"","title":"Fundamental Security Applications"},{"location":"fundSecApps/#firewalls","text":"","title":"Firewalls"},{"location":"fundSecApps/#what-is-a-firewall","text":"A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.

Network monitoring software helps to ensure visibility across your entire network, so it is important that all of the networking components are evaluated in real-time in order to maintain and optimize availability. Examples of network monitoring and analysis tools: Wireshark tcpdump PRTG Network Monitor SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor NetFlow Analyzer Nagios Colasoft Capsa NetCrunch Riverbed SteelCentral Packet Analyzer Microsoft Message Analyzer Vulnerability Scanners Vulnerability scanning is the process of discovering, analyzing, and reporting on security flaws and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans are conducted via automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential risk exposures and attack vectors across an organization\u2019s networks, hardware, software, and systems. Vulnerability scanning and assessment is an essential step in the vulnerability management lifecycle. Once vulnerabilities have been identified through scanning and assessed, an organization can pursue a remediation path, such as patching vulnerabilities, closing risky ports, fixing misconfigurations, and even changing default passwords, such as on internet of things (IoT) and other devices. Examples of vulnerability scanners: Acunetix beSECURE Burp Suite GFI Languard Frontline Nessus Nexpose Nmap OpenVAS Qualys Guard Qualys Web Application Scanner SAINT Tenable Tripwire IP360 Vulnerability scanning is a vital part of your security team\u2019s overall IT risk management approach for several reasons: Vulnerability scanning lets you take a proactive approach to close any gaps and maintain strong security for your systems, data, employees, and customers. Data breaches are often the result of unpatched vulnerabilities, so identifying and eliminating these security gaps, removes that attack vector. Cybersecurity compliance and regulations demand secure systems. For instance, NIST, PCI DSS, and HIPAA all emphasize vulnerability scanning to protect sensitive data. Cyber criminals also have access to vulnerability scanning tools, so it is vital to carry out scans and take restorative actions before hackers can exploit any security vulnerabilities. Firewall Management Tools Firewall Security Management Software allows for the monitoring and configuration of firewalls from a single interface. The software can monitor real and virtual firewalls, as well as routers, load balancers, and switches. The software can correlate network behavior to potential attacks using real-time event tracking. If firewall security management software identifies changes to security policy or potential vulnerabilities caused by policy modification, it can send notifications. Best practice information is leveraged by firewall security management software to mitigate these security issues. Any standalone or commercial firewall includes management capabilities. The breadth and depth of the software's administration capabilities are what distinguishes firewall security management as a distinct category.
