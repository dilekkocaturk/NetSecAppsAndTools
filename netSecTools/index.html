<h2 id="network-monitoring-and-analysis-tools">Network Monitoring and Analysis Tools</h2>
<p>Network monitoring is a critical IT process where all networking components such as network access, VMs, routers, servers, network devices, and switches, as well as key performance indicators like CPU utilization and network bandwidth, are monitored for bottlenecks and performance. Network monitoring software helps to ensure visibility across your entire network, so it is important that all of the networking components are evaluated in real-time in order to maintain and optimize availability.</p>
<p>Examples of network monitoring and analysis tools:
Wireshark
tcpdump
PRTG Network Monitor
SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor
NetFlow Analyzer
Nagios
Colasoft Capsa
NetCrunch
Riverbed SteelCentral Packet Analyzer
Microsoft Message Analyzer</p>
<h2 id="vulnerability-scanners">Vulnerability Scanners</h2>
<p>Vulnerability scanning is the process of discovering, analyzing, and reporting on security flaws and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans are conducted via automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential risk exposures and attack vectors across an organization’s networks, hardware, software, and systems. Vulnerability scanning and assessment is an essential step in the vulnerability management lifecycle.</p>
<p>Once vulnerabilities have been identified through scanning and assessed, an organization can pursue a remediation path, such as patching vulnerabilities, closing risky ports, fixing misconfigurations, and even changing default passwords, such as on internet of things (IoT) and other devices.</p>
<p>Examples of vulnerability scanners:
Acunetix
beSECURE
Burp Suite
GFI Languard
Frontline
Nessus
Nexpose
Nmap
OpenVAS
Qualys Guard
Qualys Web Application Scanner
SAINT
Tenable
Tripwire IP360</p>
<p>Vulnerability scanning is a vital part of your security team’s overall IT risk management approach for several reasons:
Vulnerability scanning lets you take a proactive approach to close any gaps and maintain strong security for your systems, data, employees, and customers. Data breaches are often the result of unpatched vulnerabilities, so identifying and eliminating these security gaps, removes that attack vector.
Cybersecurity compliance and regulations demand secure systems. For instance, NIST, PCI DSS, and HIPAA all emphasize vulnerability scanning to protect sensitive data.
Cyber criminals also have access to vulnerability scanning tools, so it is vital to carry out scans and take restorative actions before hackers can exploit any security vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="firewall-management-tools">Firewall Management Tools</h2>
<p>Firewall Security Management Software allows for the monitoring and configuration of firewalls from a single interface. The software can monitor real and virtual firewalls, as well as routers, load balancers, and switches. The software can correlate network behavior to potential attacks using real-time event tracking. If firewall security management software identifies changes to security policy or potential vulnerabilities caused by policy modification, it can send notifications. Best practice information is leveraged by firewall security management software to mitigate these security issues.</p>
<p>Any standalone or commercial firewall includes management capabilities. The breadth and depth of the software's administration capabilities are what distinguishes firewall security management as a distinct category.</p>
<p>Best firewall management software tools are listed below:
Skybox
Firewall Builder
AWS Firewall Manager
Cisco Firepower Management Center
FireMon
ManageEngine Firewall Analyzer
AlgoSec
Tufin SecureTrack
Firewall Browser
Palo Alto Panorama</p>
<h2 id="log-management-and-siem-tools">Log Management and SIEM Tools</h2>
<p>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and log management are two examples of software tools that allow IT organizations to monitor their security posture using log files, detect and respond to Indicators of Compromise (IoC) and conduct forensic data analysis and investigations into network events and possible attacks.</p>
<p>SIEM log management is important because it helps businesses monitor and improves their security posture. Additionally, by analyzing log data over time, administrators can develop better detection strategies and improve their overall security posture. Finally, SIEM log management help to audit compliance.</p>
<p>Examples of log management and SIEM tools:
Scalyr
Splunk
Datadog
Sumo Logic
Archeo
Log Harvestor
Backtrace
Dockter
LogRhythm</p>
<h2 id="endpoint-detection-and-response-edr-solutions">Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions</h2>
<p>Endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions detect threats across your environment, investigating the entire lifecycle of the threat, and providing insights into what happened, how it got in, where it has been, what it's doing now, and what to do about it. By containing the threat at the endpoint, EDR helps eliminate the threat before it can spread.</p>
<p>More sophisticated threats that evade perimeter defenses can wreak havoc across your network. Ransomware encrypts sensitive data and holds it hostage from the organization until the financial ransom is collected. An EDR solution can help you find, contain, and remove the threats quickly so you can ensure the security of data on endpoints across your environment.</p>
<p>Examples of EDR Solutions:
Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR
SentinelOne Singularity
CrowdStrike Falcon Insight XDR
Cynet 360 AutoXDR
Trend Micro XDR
Cybereason
FortiEDR</p>
